# Postgres TPCH Go Library

A small repository containing a representation of TPC-H's tables and updates in Go's structs, ready to be used with [Bun](https://bun.uptrace.dev) library for easier communication with PostgreSQL.
It also includes a protobuf implementation of queries, tables and inserts.

This library is required by [PostgreSQL TPC-H Go Client](https://github.com/AndreRijo/postgres-tpch-client) and was developed alongside it.
